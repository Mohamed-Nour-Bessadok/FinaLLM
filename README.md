# 🚀 **FinaLLM**

Welcome to FinaLLM! This is my attempt at Fine-Tuning an open-source LLM (Mistral 7B, although I believe it would work with any other open-source LLM) using LoRA.

📝 **Instructions:**
This notebook is designed to work in a free Google Colab environment, but feel free to adjust any parameters if you have the hardware for it.

🎉 **Enjoy!**
